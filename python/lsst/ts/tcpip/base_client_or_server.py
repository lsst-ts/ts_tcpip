class BaseClientOrServer(abc.ABC):
    """Abstract base class for a TCP/IP client or server.

    Manage a stream reader and writer:

    * Provide high-level methods for reading and writing.
    * Optionally call a callback function when the connection state changes.
    * Optionally monitor the connection in the background.

    Parameters
    ----------
    log : `logging.Logger`
        Logger.
    connect_callback : callable or `None`, optional
        Asynchronous function to call when the connection state changes.
        The function receives one argument: this `BaseClientOrServer`.

        Note: if the connection is unexpectedly lost, and you are not reading
        from the socket, it may take ``monitor_connection_interval`` seconds
        or longer to notice.
    monitor_connection_interval : `float`, optional
        Interval between checking if the connection is still alive (seconds).
        Defaults to DEFAULT_MONITOR_CONNECTION_INTERVAL.
        If ≤ 0 then do not monitor the connection at all.

        Monitoring is only useful if you do not regularly read from the reader
        using the read methods of this class.
    name : `str`
        Optional name used for log messages.
    do_start : `bool`, optional
        Call start in the constructor? Normally True (the default),
        but set False by Client when creating an already-closed Client.
    encoding : `str`
        The encoding used by `read_str` and `write_str`, `read_json`,
         and `write_json`.
    terminator : `bytes`
        The terminator used by `read_str` and `write_str`, `read_json`,
         and `write_json`.

    **kwargs : `dict` [`str`, `typing.Any`]
        Keyword arguments for start_task.

    Attributes
    ----------
    log : `logging.Logger`
        A child of the ``log`` constructor argument.
    name : `str`
        The ``name`` constructor argument.
    encoding : `str`
        The ``encoding`` constructor argument.
    terminator : `bytes`
        The ``terminator`` constructor argument.
    reader : `asyncio.StreamReader` or None
        Stream reader to read data from the server.
        This will be a stream reader (not None) if `connected` is True.
    writer : `asyncio.StreamWriter` or None
        Stream writer to write data to the server.
        This will be a stream writer (not None) if `connected` is True.
    start_task : `asyncio.Future`
        Future that is set done when:

        * The connection is made, for the `Client` subclass.
        * The server is ready to receive connections, for Server subclasses.

    done_task : `asyncio.Future`
        Future that is set done when this instance is closed, at which point
        the instance is no longer usable.
    should_be_connected : `bool`
        This flag helps you determine if you unexpectedly lost the connection
        (e.g. if the other end hung up). It is set true when the connection
        is made and false when you call `close`, or
        `OneClientServer.close_client`. The connection was unexpectedy lost
        if `connected` is false and ``should_be_connected`` is true.

        If your CSC unexpectedly loses its connection to a low-level
        controller, you should send the CSC to fault state.

    Raises
    ------
    `TypeError`
        If `connect_callback` is synchronous.

    Notes
    -----
    Always wait for ``start_task`` after constructing an instance,
    before using the instance.

    This class provides high-level read and write methods that monitor
    the connection (to call ``connect_callback`` as needed) and reject
    any attempt to read or write if not connected. Please use them.

    This class can be used as an async context manager, which may be useful
    for unit tests.

    Subclasses should call `_start_monitoring_connection` from the `start`
    method, if monitoring is needed.
