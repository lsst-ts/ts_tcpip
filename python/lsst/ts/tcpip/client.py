class Client(BaseClientOrServer):
    """A TCP/IP socket client.

    A thin wrapper around `asyncio.open_connection`. Like that function,
    it can only be used to connect once. Construct a new instance each
    time you wish to make a new connection.

    Parameters
    ----------
    host : `str` | `None`
        IP address. If blank ("") then create a Client that is
        already closed.
    port : `int` | `None`
        IP port.
    log : `logging.Logger`
        Logger.
    connect_callback : callable or `None`, optional
        Asynchronous function to call when the connection state changes.
        If the other end (server) closes the connection, it may take
        ``monitor_connection_interval`` seconds or longer to notice.
        The function receives one argument: this `Client`.
    monitor_connection_interval : `float`, optional
        Interval between checking if the connection is still alive (seconds).
        Defaults to DEFAULT_MONITOR_CONNECTION_INTERVAL.
        If â‰¤ 0 then do not monitor the connection at all.
        Monitoring is only useful if you do not regularly read from the reader
        using the read methods of this class (or copying what they do
        to detect and report hangups).
    name : `str`
        Optional name used for log messages.
    encoding : `str`
        The encoding used by `read_str` and `write_str`, `read_json`,
         and `write_json`.
    terminator : `bytes`
        The terminator used by `read_str` and `write_str`, `read_json`,
         and `write_json`.
    run_heartbeat_send_task : `bool`
        Should the task to send heartbeats be started or not? The default
        is False because the OneClientReadLoopServer delegates reading data
        from the socket to subclasses and by default sending heartbeats would
        be a breaking change.
    heartbeat_send_sleep : `float`
        The time [sec] between heartbeats. The default is 1.0 sec.
    **kwargs : `dict` [`str`, `typing.Any`]
        Additional keyword arguments for `asyncio.open_connection`,
        beyond host and port.

    Attributes
    ----------
    host : `str` | `None`
        IP address; the ``host`` constructor argument.
    port : `int` | `None`
        IP port; the ``port`` constructor argument.
    plus...
        Attributes provided by parent class `BaseClientOrServer`.

    Notes
    -----
    See `tests/test_example.py <https://ls.st/514>`_ for an example.

    Creating an already-closed Client by specifying host="" allows you to
    initialize a client attribute in a CSC or other class, in such a way that
    it is safe to access `connected` and ``should_be_connected``
    (both of which will be False), and call `close` (which will be a no-op).
    You can also await ``start_task`` and ``done_task`` if you wish,
    but both will be done when constructed.

    Always wait for ``start_task`` after constructing an instance
    before using the instance. This indicates the client has connected
    and is ready to read and write data.
    The sole exception is specifying host="" to create a Client that is
    already closed, since you will never use those to read or write data
    and both ``start_task`` and ``done_task`` are already done when created.

    This class provides high-level read and write methods that monitor
    the connection (to call ``connect_callback`` as needed) and reject
    any attempt to read or write if not connected. Please use them.

    This class can be used as an async context manager, which may be useful
    for unit tests.
