class OneClientServer(BaseClientOrServer):
    """A TCP/IP socket server that serves a single client.

    If additional clients try to connect, they are rejected.

    Parameters
    ----------
    port : `int`
        IP port for this server. If 0 then randomly pick an available port
        (or ports, if listening on multiple sockets).
        0 is strongly recommended for unit tests.
    host : `str` or `None`
        IP address for this server. Common values include `DEFAULT_LOCALHOST`,
        `LOCALHOST_IPV4` to force IPV4 or `LOCALHOST_IPV6` for IPV6.
        If `None` then bind to all network interfaces
        (e.g. listen on an IPv4 socket and an IPv6 socket).
        Warning: `None` can cause trouble with ``port=0``; see ``port``
        in the Attributes section for more information.
    log : `logging.Logger`
        Logger.
    connect_callback : callable or `None`, optional
        Asynchronous or (deprecated) synchronous function to call when
        a client connects or disconnects.
        If the other end (client) closes the connection, it may take
        ``monitor_connection_interval`` seconds or longer to notice.
        The function receives one argument: this `OneClientServer`.
    monitor_connection_interval : `float`, optional
        Interval between checking if the connection is still alive (seconds).
        Defaults to DEFAULT_MONITOR_CONNECTION_INTERVAL.
        If â‰¤ 0 then do not monitor the connection at all.
        Monitoring is only useful if you do not regularly read from the reader
        using the read methods of this class (or copying what they do
        to detect and report hangups).
    name : `str`, optional
        Name used for log messages, e.g. "Commands" or "Telemetry".
    encoding : `str`
        The encoding used by `read_str` and `write_str`, `read_json`,
         and `write_json`.
    terminator : `bytes`
        The terminator used by `read_str` and `write_str`, `read_json`,
         and `write_json`.
    **kwargs : `dict` [`str`, `typing.Any`]
        Additional keyword arguments for `asyncio.start_server`,
        beyond host and port.

    Attributes
    ----------
    host : `str` | `None`
        IP address; the ``host`` constructor argument.
    port : `int`
        The port on which this server is running.

        If you specify port=0 and the server is only listening on one socket,
        then the port attribute is set to the randomly chosen port.
        However, if the server is listening on more than one socket,
        the port is ambiguous (since each socket will have a different port)
        and will be left at 0; in that case you will have to examine
        server.sockets to determine the port you want.

        To make the server listen on only one socket with port=0,
        specify the host as a string instead of None. For example:

        * IP4: ``host=LOCALHOST_IPV4, port=0``
        * IP6: ``host="::", port=0``

        An alternative that allows host=None is to specify family as
        `socket.AF_INET` for IPv4, or `socket.AF_INET6` for IPv6.
    connected_task : `asyncio.Future`
        Future that is set done when a client connects.
        You may set replace it with a new `asyncio.Future`
        if you want to detect when another connection is made
        after the current client disconnects.
    plus...
        Attributes provided by parent class `BaseClientOrServer`.

    Notes
    -----
    See `tests/test_example.py <https://ls.st/514>`_ for an example.

    Always wait for ``start_task`` after constructing an instance,
    before using the instance. This indicates that the server
    has started listening for a connection.

    You may wait for ``connected_task`` to wait until a client connects.

    This class provides high-level read and write methods that monitor
    the connection (to call ``connect_callback`` as needed) and reject
    any attempt to read or write if not connected. Please use them.

    Can be used as an async context manager, which may be useful for unit
    tests.
